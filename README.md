                                                              👋 Hi, I’m @BrianClark1
    
I am a full-stack developer from New York and I enjoy contributing to the open-source community. I enjoy the process of finding a problem, developing ways to solve it, and then executing on said ways. I find that it helps my creativity and analytical skills.
      
- 👀 I’m interested in Machine Learning applications for speech recognition software along with trading algorithms.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python through Automate the Boring Stuff!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any Project associated with Python!
- 📫 How to reach me ... briansclark1@gmail.com or on LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/brianclarkeit/
